# Introduction

This notebook contains several examples of how to use [Stan](https://mc-stan.org) in R with [__brms__](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/). This notebook assumes basic knowledge of Bayesian inference and MCMC. The examples are related to [Bayesian data analysis course](https://avehtari.github.io/BDA_course_Aalto/).

# Bernoulli model

Toy data with sequence of failures (0) and successes (1). We would
like to learn about the unknown probability of success.

```{r}
data_bern <- data.frame(y = c(1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0))
```

brms uses by default student_t(3, 0, 2.5), bu we can assign uniform
prior (beta(1,1)). 

```{r results='hide'}
fit_bern <- brm(y ~ 1, family = bernoulli(), data = data_bern,
                prior = prior("", class='Intercept'),
                seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence

```{r}
fit_bern
```

Extract the posterior draws

```{r}
draws <- as_draws_df(fit_bern)
```

We can get summary information using summarise_draws()

```{r}
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='b_Intercept') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

We can compute the probability of success by using plogis which is
equal to inverse-logit function

```{r}
draws <- draws |>
  mutate_variables(theta=plogis(b_Intercept))
```

Summary of theta by using summarise_draws()

```{r}
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='theta') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

Histogram of theta

```{r}
mcmc_hist(draws, pars='theta') +
  xlab('theta') +
  xlim(c(0,1))
```

We next compare the result to using normal(0, 1) prior on logit
probability. Visualize the prior by drawing samples from it

```{r}
prior_mean <- 0
prior_sd <- 1
prior_draws <- data.frame(
                 theta = plogis(rnorm(20000, prior_mean, prior_sd)))
mcmc_hist(prior_draws) +
  xlim(c(0,1))

```
```{r results='hide'}
fit_bern <- brm(y ~ 1, family = bernoulli(), data = data_bern,
                prior = prior(normal(0, 1), class='Intercept'),
                seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence

```{r}
fit_bern
```

We can examine the latent parameter

```{r}
draws <- as_draws_df(fit_bern)
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='b_Intercept') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

We can compute the probability of success by using plogis which is
equal to inverse-logit function

```{r}
draws <- draws |>
  mutate_variables(theta=plogis(b_Intercept))
```

Summary of theta by using summarise_draws()

```{r}
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='theta') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

Histogram of theta

```{r}
mcmc_hist(draws, pars='theta') +
  xlab('theta') +
  xlim(c(0,1))
```

As the number of observations is small, there is small change in
the posterior mean when the prior is changed. You can experiment
with different priors and varying the number of observations.


# Binomial model

Instead of sequence of 0's and 1's, we can summarize the data with
the number of trials and the number successes and use Binomial
model. The prior is specified in the 'latent space'. The actual
probability of success, theta = plogis(alpha), where plogis is the
inverse of the logistic function.

Visualize the prior by drawing samples from it

```{r}
prior_mean <- 0
prior_sd <- 1
prior_draws <- data.frame(theta = plogis(rnorm(20000, prior_mean, prior_sd)))
mcmc_hist(prior_draws)
```

Binomial model with the same data

```{r}
data_bin <- data.frame(N = c(10), y = c(7))
```
```{r results='hide'}
fit_bin <- brm(y | trials(N) ~ 1, family = binomial(), data = data_bin,
               prior = prior(normal(0,1), class='Intercept'),
               seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence

```{r}
fit_bin
```

Extract the posterior draws

```{r}
draws <- as_draws_df(fit_bin)
```

We can get summary information using summarise_draws()

```{r}
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='b_Intercept') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

We can compute the probability of success by using plogis which is
equal to inverse-logit function

```{r}
draws <- draws |>
  mutate_variables(theta=plogis(b_Intercept))
```

Summary of theta by using summarise_draws()

```{r}
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='theta') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

Histogram of theta

```{r}
mcmc_hist(draws, pars='theta') +
  xlab('theta') +
  xlim(c(0,1))
```

Re-run the model with a new data dataset without recompiling

```{r}
data_bin <- data.frame(N = c(5), y = c(4))
fit_bin <- update(fit_bin, newdata = data_bin)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence

```{r}
fit_bin
```

Extract the posterior draws

```{r}
draws <- as_draws_df(fit_bin)
```

We can get summary information using summarise_draws()

```{r}
draws |>
  subset_draws(variable='b_Intercept') |>
  summarise_draws()
```

# Comparison of two groups with Binomial 

An experiment was performed to estimate the effect of beta-blockers
on mortality of cardiac patients. A group of patients were randomly
assigned to treatment and control groups:

- out of 674 patients receiving the control, 39 died
- out of 680 receiving the treatment, 22 died

Data, where `grp2` is an indicator variable defined as a factor
type, which is useful for categorical variables.

```{r}
data_bin2 <- data.frame(N = c(674, 680), y = c(39,22), grp2 = factor(c('control','treatment')))
```

To analyse whether the treatment is useful, we can use Binomial
model for both groups and compute odds-ratio.

```{r}
fit_bin2 <- brm(y | trials(N) ~ grp2, family = binomial(), data = data_bin2,
                prior = prior(normal(0,1), class='Intercept'),
                seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence. brms is using
the first factor level `control` as the baseline and thus reports
the coefficient (population-level effect) for `treatment` (shown s
`grp2treatment`)

```{r}
fit_bin2
```

Compute theta for each group and the odds-ratio

```{r}
draws_bin2 <- as_draws_df(fit_bin2) |>
  mutate(theta_control = plogis(b_Intercept),
         theta_treatment = plogis(b_Intercept + b_grp2treatment),
         oddsratio = (theta_treatment/(1-theta_treatment))/(theta_control/(1-theta_control)))
```

Plot oddsratio

```{r}
mcmc_hist(draws_bin2, pars='oddsratio') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0.2,1.6,by=0.2))+
  geom_vline(xintercept=1, linetype='dashed')
```

Probability that the oddsratio<1

```{r}
draws_bin2 |>
  mutate(poddsratio = oddsratio<1) |>
  subset(variable='poddsratio') |>
  summarise_draws(mean, mcse_mean)
```

oddratio 95% posterior interval

```{r}
draws_bin2 |>
  subset(variable='oddsratio') |>
  summarise_draws(~quantile(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)), ~mcse_quantile(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)))
```

# Linear Gaussian model

Use the Kilpisjärvi summer month temperatures 1952--2022 data from `aaltobda` package

```{r}
load(url('https://github.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/raw/master/rpackage/data/kilpisjarvi2022.rda'))
data_lin <- data.frame(year = kilpisjarvi2022$year,
                       temp = kilpisjarvi2022$temp.summer)
```

Plot the data

```{r}
data_lin |>
  ggplot(aes(year, temp)) +
  geom_point(color=2) +
  labs(x= "Year", y = 'Summer temp. @Kilpisjärvi') +
  guides(linetype = "none")
```

To analyse has there been change in the average summer month
temperature we use a linear model with Gaussian model for the
unexplained variation. By default brms uses uniform prior for the
coefficients.

`temp ~ year` means temp depends on the intercept and `temp`.
The model could also be defined as `temp ~ 1 + year` which explicitly shows the
intercept part. The corresponding regression model is
temp ~ normal(b_Intercept*1 + b_year*year, sigma)

```{r}
fit_lin <- brm(temp ~ year, data = data_lin, family = gaussian(),
               seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

We can check the all the priors used. In general it is good to use
proper priors, but sometimes flat priors are fine and produce
proper posterior.

```{r}
prior_summary(fit_lin)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence

```{r}
fit_lin
```

Extract the posterior draws and check the summaries

```{r}
draws_lin <- as_draws_df(fit_lin) 
draws_lin |> summarise_draws()
```

If one of the columns is hidden we can force printing all columns

```{r}
draws_lin |> summarise_draws() |> print(width=Inf)
```

Histogram of b_year

```{r}
draws_lin |>
  mcmc_hist(pars='b_year') +
  xlab('Average temperature increase per year')
```

Probability that the coefficient b_year > 0 and the corresponding MCSE

```{r}
draws_lin |>
  mutate(I_b_year_gt_0 = b_year>0) |>
  subset_draws(variable='I_b_year_gt_0') |>
  summarise_draws(mean, mcse_mean)
```

95% posterior interval for temperature increase per 100 years

```{r}
draws_lin |>
  mutate(b_year_100 = b_year*100) |>
  subset_draws(variable='b_year_100') |>
  summarise_draws(~quantile(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)),
                  ~mcse_quantile(.x, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)),
                  .num_args = list(digits = 2, notation = "dec"))
```

Plot posterior draws of the linear function values at each year.
`add_linpred_draws()` takes the years from the data and uses `fit_lin` to make
the predictions.

```{r}
data_lin |>
  add_linpred_draws(fit_lin) |>
  # plot data
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=temp)) +
  geom_point(color=2) +
  # plot lineribbon for the linear model
  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .linpred), .width = c(.95), alpha = 1/2, color=brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[[5]]) +
  # decoration
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(x= "Year", y = 'Summer temp. @Kilpisjärvi') +
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2020,by=10))
```

Alternativelly plot a spaghetti plot for 100 draws

```{r}
data_lin |>
  add_linpred_draws(fit_lin, ndraws=100) |>
  # plot data
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=temp)) +
  geom_point(color=2) +
  # plot a line for each posterior draw
  geom_line(aes(y=.linpred, group=.draw), alpha = 1/2, color = brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[[3]])+
  # decoration
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(x= "Year", y = 'Summer temp. @Kilpisjärvi') +
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2020,by=10))
```

Plot posterior predictive distribution at each year until 2030
`add_predicted_draws()` takes the years from the data and uses
`fit_lin` to make the predictions.

```{r}
data_lin |>
  add_row(year=2023:2030) |>
  add_predicted_draws(fit_lin) |>
  # plot data
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=temp)) +
  geom_point(color=2) +
  # plot lineribbon for the linear model
  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .prediction), .width = c(.95), alpha = 1/2, color=brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[[5]]) +
  # decoration
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(x= "Year", y = 'Summer temp. @Kilpisjärvi') +
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2030,by=10))
```

# Linear Student's t model

The temperatures used in the above analyses are averages over three
months, which makes it more likely that they are normally
distributed, but there can be extreme events in the feather and we
can check whether more robust Student's t observation model woul
give different results.


```{r results='hide'}
fit_lin_t <- brm(temp ~ year, data = data_lin, family = student(),
                 seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence. The b_year
posterior looks similar as before and the posterior for degrees of
freedom `nu` has most of the posterior mas for quite large values
indicating there is no strong support for thick tailed variation in
temperature.

```{r}
fit_lin_t
```

# Pareto-smoothed importance-sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO)

We can use leave-one-out cross-validation to compare the expected predictive performance.

LOO comparison shows normal and Student's t model have similar performance.

```{r}
loo_compare(loo(fit_lin), loo(fit_lin_t))
```

# Heteroskedastic linear model

Heteroskedasticity assumes that the variation around the linear
mean can also vary. We can allow sigma to depend on year, too.
Although the additional component is written as `sigma ~ year`, the
log link function is used and the model is for log(sigma). `bf()` allows
listing several formulas.


```{r results='hide'}
fit_lin_h <- brm(bf(temp ~ year,
                    sigma ~ year),
                 data = data_lin, family = gaussian(),
                 seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence. The b_year
posterior looks similar as before. The posterior for sigma_year
looks like having mosst of the ma for negative values, indicating
decrease in temperature variation around the mean.

```{r}
fit_lin_h
```

Histogram of b_year and b_sigma_year

```{r}
as_draws_df(fit_lin_h) |>
  mcmc_areas(pars=c('b_year', 'b_sigma_year'))
```

As log(x) is almost linear when x is close to zero, we can see that the
sigma is decreasing about 1% per year (95% interval from 0% to 2%).

Plot posterior predictive distribution at each year until 2030
`add_predicted_draws()` takes the years from the data and uses
`fit_lin_h` to make the predictions.

```{r}
data_lin |>
  add_row(year=2023:2030) |>
  add_predicted_draws(fit_lin_h) |>
  # plot data
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=temp)) +
  geom_point(color=2) +
  # plot lineribbon for the linear model
  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .prediction), .width = c(.95), alpha = 1/2, color=brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[[5]]) +
  # decoration
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(x= "Year", y = 'Summer temp. @Kilpisjärvi') +
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2030,by=10))
```

We can use leave-one-out cross-validation to compare the expected predictive performance.

LOO comparison shows homoskedastic normal and heteroskedastic
normal models have similar performances.

```{r}
loo_compare(loo(fit_lin), loo(fit_lin_h))
```

# Heteroskedastic non-linear model

We can test the linearity assumption by using non-linear spline
functions, by uing `s(year)` terms. Sampling is slower as the
posterior gets more complex.


```{r results='hide'}
fit_lin_hs <- brm(bf(temp ~ s(year),
                     sigma ~ s(year)),
                  data = data_lin, family = gaussian(),
                  seed = SEED, refresh = 0)
```

We get warnings about divergences, and try rerunning with higher
adapt_delta, which leads to using smaller step sizes. Often
`adapt_delta=0.999` leads to very slow sampling, but with this
small data, this is not an issue.

```{r}
fit_lin_hs <- update(fit_lin_hs, control = list(adapt_delta=0.999))
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence. The b_year
posterior looks similar as before. The posterior for sigma_year
looks like having mosst of the ma for negative values, indicating
decrease in temperature variation around the mean.

```{r}
fit_lin_hs
```

Plot posterior predictive distribution at each year until 2030
`add_predicted_draws()` takes the years from the data and uses
`fit_lin_h` to make the predictions.

```{r}
data_lin |>
  add_row(year=2023:2030) |>
  add_predicted_draws(fit_lin_hs) |>
  # plot data
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=temp)) +
  geom_point(color=2) +
  # plot lineribbon for the linear model
  stat_lineribbon(aes(y = .prediction), .width = c(.95), alpha = 1/2, color=brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[[5]]) +
  # decoration
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(x= "Year", y = 'Summer temp. @Kilpisjärvi') +
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1950,2030,by=10))
```

We can use leave-one-out cross-validation to compare the expected predictive performance.

LOO comparison shows homoskedastic normal linear and
heteroskedastic normal spline models have similar
performances. There are not enough observations to make clear
difference between the models.

```{r}
loo_compare(loo(fit_lin), loo(fit_lin_hs))
```


# Comparison of k groups with hierarchical normal models

Load factory data, which contain 5 quality measurements for each of
6 machines. We're interested in analying are the quality differences
between the machines.

```{r}
factory <- read.table(url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avehtari/BDA_course_Aalto/master/rpackage/data-raw/factory.txt'))
colnames(factory) <- 1:6
factory
```

We pivot the data to long format

```{r}
factory <- factory |>
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(),
               names_to = 'machine',
               values_to = 'quality')
factory
```

## Pooled model

As comparison make also pooled model

```{r}
fit_pooled <- brm(quality ~ 1, data = factory, refresh=0)
```

## Separate model

As comparison make also seprate model. To make it completely
separate we need to have different sigma for each machine, too.

```{r}
fit_separate <- brm(bf(quality ~ machine,
                       sigma ~ machine),
                    data = factory, refresh=0)
```

# Common variance hierarchical model (ANOVA)


```{r}
fit_hier <- brm(quality ~ 1 + (1 | machine),
                data = factory, refresh = 0)
```

Check the summary of the posterior and convergence.

```{r}
fit_hier
```

LOO comparison shows the hierarchical model is the best

```{r}
loo_compare(loo(fit_pooled), loo(fit_separate), loo(fit_hier))
```

Distributions of quality differences from the mean quality

```{r}
mcmc_areas(as_draws_df(fit_hier), regex_pars='r_machine')
```

Posterior predictive distributions for 6 old and 1 new machines

```{r}
posterior_predict(fit_hier, newdata=data.frame(machine=1:7, quality=rep(NA,7)),
                  allow_new_levels=TRUE) |>

```


# Hierarchical binomial model

[Sorafenib Toxicity Dataset in `metadat` R package](https://wviechtb.github.io/metadat/reference/dat.ursino2021.html)
includes results frm 13 studies investigating the occurrence of
dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at different doses of Sorafenib.

Load data

```{r}
load(url('https://github.com/wviechtb/metadat/raw/master/data/dat.ursino2021.rda'))
head(dat.ursino2021)
```

Pooled model assumes all studies have the same dose effect

```{r}
fit_pooled <- brm(events | trials(total) ~ dose,
                  family=binomial(), data=dat.ursino2021)
```

Separate model assumes all studies have different dose effect

```{r}
fit_separate <- brm(events | trials(total) ~ dose:study,
                    family=binomial(), data=dat.ursino2021)
fit_separate <- update(fit_separate, control=list(init=0.1))
```

Hierarchical model assumes common mean effect and variation round with normal population prior

```{r}
fit_hier <- brm(events | trials(total) ~ dose + (dose | study),
                family=binomial(), data=dat.ursino2021)
fit_hier <- update(fit_hier, control=list(adapt_delta=0.99))
```

LOO-CV comparison

```{r}
loo_compare(loo(fit_pooled), loo(fit_separate), loo(fit_hier))
```

We get warnings about Pareto k's > 0.7 in PSIS-LOO for separate
model, but as in that case the LOO-CV estimate is usually
overoptimistic and the separate model is the worst, there is no
need to use more accurate computation.

Hierarchical model has better elpd than the pooled, but difference
is negligible. However, when we look at the study specific
parameters, we see that the Miller study has higher intercept (more
events).

```{r}
mcmc_areas(as_draws_df(fit_hier), regex_pars='r_study\\[.*Intercept')
```


There are no differences in slopes.

```{r}
mcmc_areas(as_draws_df(fit_hier), regex_pars='r_study\\[.*dose')
```


The coefficient for the dose is clearly larger than 0

```{r}
mcmc_areas(as_draws_df(fit_hier), regex_pars='b_dose') +
  geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype='dashed') +
  xlim(c(0,0.01))
```

The posterior for the probability of event given certain dose and a new study

```{r}
data.frame(study='new',
           dose=seq(100,1000,by=100),
           total=1) |>
  add_linpred_draws(fit_hier, transform=TRUE, allow_new_levels=TRUE) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=dose, y=.linpred)) +
  stat_lineribbon(.width = c(.95), alpha = 1/2, color=brewer.pal(5, "Blues")[[5]]) +
  scale_fill_brewer()+
  labs(x= "Dose", y = 'Probability of event') +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(100,1000,by=100))
```

Posterior predictive checking

```{r}
pp_check(fit_hier, type = "ribbon_grouped", group="study")
```
