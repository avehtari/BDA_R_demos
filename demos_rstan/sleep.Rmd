# Does brain mass predict how much mammals sleep in a day?

Original notebook by Tristan Mahr https://tjmahr.github.io/visualizing-uncertainty-rstanarm/.
Tristan's model had the problem that it would predict sleep times over 24h per day.

Let’s use the mammal sleep dataset from ggplot2. This dataset contains the number of hours spent sleeping per day for 83 different species of mammals along with each species’ brain mass (kg) and body mass (kg), among other measures. Here’s a first look at the data.
Preview sorted by brain/body ratio. The sorting was chosen so that humans show up in the preview.
```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
msleep %>% 
  select(name, sleep_total, brainwt, bodywt, everything()) %>% 
    arrange(desc(brainwt / bodywt))
```

Choose animals with known average brain weight, and add some transformed variables.
```{r}
msleep <- msleep %>% 
  filter(!is.na(brainwt)) %>% 
  mutate(log_brainwt = log10(brainwt), 
         log_bodywt = log10(bodywt), 
         log_sleep_total = log10(sleep_total),
         logit_sleep_ratio = qlogis(sleep_total/24))
```

Make a list of examples and give some familiar species shorter names
```{r}
ex_mammals <- c("Domestic cat", "Human", "Dog", "Cow", "Rabbit",
                "Big brown bat", "House mouse", "Horse", "Golden hamster")
renaming_rules <- c(
  "Domestic cat" = "Cat", 
  "Golden hamster" = "Hamster", 
  "House mouse" = "Mouse")

ex_points <- msleep %>% 
  filter(name %in% ex_mammals) %>% 
  mutate(name = stringr::str_replace_all(name, renaming_rules))
```

Define these labels only once for all the plots
```{r}
lab_lines <- list(
  brain_log = "Brain mass (kg., log-scaled)", 
  sleep_raw = "Sleep per day (hours)",
  sleep_log = "Sleep per day (log-hours)"
)
```

Plot sleep times vs. average brain weights
```{r}
ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = brainwt, y = sleep_total) + 
  geom_point(color = "grey40") +
  # Circles around highlighted points + labels
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 1, color = "grey40", data = ex_points) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = name), data = ex_points) + 
  # Use log scaling on x-axis
  scale_x_log10(breaks = c(.001, .01, .1, 1)) + 
    labs(x = lab_lines$brain_log, y = lab_lines$sleep_raw)
```

Next we use stan_glm from rstanarm package to make a linear model for logit of the sleep ratio given log of the brain weight (Tristan made the model with untransformed variables).
```{r}
library(rstanarm)
m1 <- stan_glm(
  logit_sleep_ratio ~ log_brainwt, 
  family = gaussian(), 
  data = msleep, 
  prior = normal(0, 3),
  prior_intercept = normal(0, 3))
```

Prepare x values for prediction:
```{r}
x_rng <- range(msleep$log_brainwt) 
x_steps <- seq(x_rng[1], x_rng[2], length.out = 80)
new_data <- data_frame(
  observation = seq_along(x_steps), 
  log_brainwt = x_steps)
```

Predict expected sleep time at new x values:
```{r}
preds<-posterior_linpred(m1,newdata=new_data)
preds<-plogis(preds)*24
```

Plot draws of the expected sleep time lines:
```{r}
library(reshape2)
gg<-data.frame(log_brainwt=new_data$log_brainwt,preds=t(preds[1:400,]))
gg<-melt(gg,id=c("log_brainwt"))
names(gg)<-c("log_brainwt","pp","preds")

# aesthetic controllers
alpha_level <- .15
col_draw <- "grey60"
col_median <-  "#3366FF"

ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = log_brainwt, y = sleep_total) + 
  # Plot a random sample of rows as gray semi-transparent lines
  geom_line(aes(x=log_brainwt, y=preds, group=pp), 
              data = gg, color = col_draw, 
              alpha = alpha_level) + 
  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) 10 ^ x) +
  labs(x = lab_lines$brain_log, y = lab_lines$sleep_raw)
```

Predict distribution of sleep times at new x values:
```{r}
preds_post <- posterior_predict(m1, newdata = new_data)
preds_post<-plogis(preds_post)*24
```

Plot distribution of sleep times at new x values:
```{r}
pq<-data.frame(t(apply(t(preds_post), 1, quantile, probs = c(0.025, 0.5, 0.995), na.rm = TRUE)))
names(pq)<-c("lower","median","upper")
pq$log_brainwt<-new_data$log_brainwt

ggplot(msleep) + 
  aes(x = log_brainwt) + 
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), data = pq, 
              alpha = 0.4, fill = "grey60") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = median), data = pq, colour = "#3366FF", size = 1) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = sleep_total)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) 10 ^ x) +
      labs(x = lab_lines$brain_log, y = lab_lines$sleep_raw)
```

Here the distribution of the sleep times is restricted to be between 0 and 24 hours.
